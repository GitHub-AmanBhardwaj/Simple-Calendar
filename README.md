# Calendar Display Program

This project is a C++ program that generates and displays the calendar for a given month and year without relying on any inbuilt libraries for calendar generation. The program uses a custom algorithm to calculate the day of the week and handles leap years independently.

## Features
1. **No Inbuilt Libraries**: The program does not use any inbuilt libraries for calendar-related functionality. All calculations are performed using custom logic.
2. **Leap Year Support**: Automatically adjusts February days for leap years.
3. **Dynamic Starting Day**: Calculates the starting day of the week for the given month and year.
4. **Formatted Calendar**: Displays the calendar in a neat tabular format.

2. Run the executable and follow the instructions:
   - Enter the month number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.).
   - Enter the year (e.g., 2023).
3. The program will display the calendar for the specified month and year.
